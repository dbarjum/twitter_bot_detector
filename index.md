# Detecting Twitter Bots

>By Yalda Amini, João Araujo and Daniel Barjum, May 2019

## Problem Statement

With spread of social media and their increasing impact on the news the topic of bots and spread of fake news is one of the hot topics now. The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques which we have learned during this semester to detect the tweets which were generated by Twitter bots from human users.

## Literature Review

Bots have a heavy presence in the social media. “Of all tweeted links to popular websites, 66% are shared by accounts with characteristics common among automated “bots,” rather than human users.” . Due to this huge impact of pots on many political, social and economical topics around the world There is considerable literature trying to solve the issue of the fake bot generated contents in social media. Based on Ferrera et all paper in 2018, there are three types of approaches to detect bot generated contents in social media, consisting “(a) methods based on social network; (b) systems based on crowd-sourcing and human computation; (c) algorithms based on predictive features that separate bots from humans“ . Recently using RNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks seems to provide good performance for bot detection.
